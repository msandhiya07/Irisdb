Iris Dataset
This repository contains the Iris dataset in CSV format. The dataset is commonly used for machine learning tasks, including classification and clustering, and is often a part of the introductory tutorials in data science and machine learning.

Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset consists of 150 rows and 5 columns. Each row represents a flower sample with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and one target variable (species of the flower).

Columns:
SepalLengthCm: Length of the sepal in centimeters.
SepalWidthCm: Width of the sepal in centimeters.
PetalLengthCm: Length of the petal in centimeters.
PetalWidthCm: Width of the petal in centimeters.
Species: The species of the Iris flower. This column contains three possible values: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.
Example:
SepalLengthCm	SepalWidthCm	PetalLengthCm	PetalWidthCm	Species
5.1	3.5	1.4	0.2	Iris-setosa
4.9	3.0	1.4	0.2	Iris-setosa
4.7	3.2	1.3	0.2	Iris-setosa
